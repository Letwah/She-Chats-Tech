        <h2>Welcome to She Chats Tech!</h2>
        <p>
          We’re an inclusive community that empowers women to enter and thrive
          in the tech industry. Our organisation was founded in 2023 by a tech
          career changer who felt frustrated by the lack of communities for tech
          career changers. The tech industry isn’t as diverse, inclusive or
          representative as it can be -we want to change that for our generation
          and generations to come. Our aim is to provide a space where members
          can:
          <p>⭐ Be their authentic selves</p>
          <p>⭐ Be their authentic selves</p>
          <p>⭐ Cultivate genuine connections</p>
