            Yesterday was fantastic! It was really helpful to review some
            industry jargon. I also appreciated the time both you and Kim took
            to discuss the best approaches when seeking help from your
            colleagues.

            I found She Chats Tech by the word of mouth - I was looking for a
            community of girls where I could feel comfortable and welcome
            despite the stage Iâ€™m at with tech. Em is such an inspiration, her
            support, advice and kindness is something that we donâ€™t see very
            often these days.

            Getting involved in the community and meeting other girls that are
            in a similar situation as me has been a huge blessing. I realised
            that everyone has their own time and everything will fall into
            place.

            What I really love is the idea of a group chat when we can share our
            thoughts, experiences and support each other! Having online sessions
            with other women are super inspirational and make me believe that I
            can also be successful and achieve my goals.
